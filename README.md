A simple application in order to learn OpenGL. I wanted to learn OpenGL but unfortunately my college does not teach any graphical programming classes at the moment.

The code is sprinkled with notes that I wrote to myself in order
to learn some critical concepts.

I'm currently following this tutorial, and so far
it's been helping me find order in the chaos that is OpenGL:
